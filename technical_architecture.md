# AURA Platform Technical Architecture

## Overview

AURA (Auditing Universal Risk Analytics) is a cloud-native, AI-powered auditing risk monitoring solution designed to enhance audit efficiency, accuracy, and foresight. This document outlines the technical architecture of the AURA platform, focusing on the demo implementation.

## System Architecture

The AURA platform follows a modern, microservices-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │     │    Business     │     │      Data       │
│      Layer      │◄────┤      Layer      │◄────┤      Layer      │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
       React              FastAPI Services         Data Sources &
     Components              & Logic               AI/ML Models
```

### Frontend (Presentation Layer)

Built with React, the frontend provides an interactive user interface for audit professionals to:
- Visualize risk across multiple dimensions
- Analyze financial trends and anomalies
- Explore asset structure and business operations
- Receive and respond to risk alerts
- Monitor public opinion and sentiment

### Backend (Business Layer)

Developed with Python using FastAPI, the backend provides:
- REST API endpoints to serve data to the frontend
- Mock data generation for demonstration purposes
- Business logic for risk analysis and aggregation
- Platform management capabilities for data sources and models

### Data & AI Layer (Conceptual)

In the demo implementation, this layer is simulated but would include:
- Multiple data source connections
- Data processing pipeline
- AI model deployment and monitoring
- Feature engineering automation

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Data Fetching**: Native Fetch API
- **Visualization**: Various charting libraries

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI (built into FastAPI)

### Deployment
- **Backend Server**: Uvicorn (ASGI server)
- **Frontend Serving**: Static file serving (development: React dev server)

## Key Components

### Data Integration

AURA integrates multiple data sources to provide a comprehensive view of audit risks:

1. **Financial Data**
   - Balance Sheet
   - Income Statement
   - Cash Flow Statement
   - Financial Ratios

2. **Operational Data**
   - Performance metrics
   - Business process indicators
   - Warning signals

3. **External Data**
   - News sentiment
   - Social media analysis
   - Macroeconomic indicators

4. **Platform Management Data**
   - Data source connections
   - Model monitoring
   - Data quality metrics

### Risk Analysis Engine

The platform employs several specialized analysis components:

1. **Financial Risk Analysis**
   - Ratio analysis
   - Trend detection
   - Anomaly identification

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - News article processing
   - Social media monitoring
   - Keyword extraction

3. **Alert Generation**
   - Risk threshold monitoring
   - Alert prioritization
   - Audit impact assessment

4. **"Weather Forecast" Risk Indicators**
   - Overall risk assessment
   - Visual risk communication

### AI Model Management

The platform demonstrates comprehensive AI model management capabilities:

1. **Model Registry**
   - Model versioning
   - Performance tracking
   - Status monitoring

2. **Model Health Monitoring**
   - Drift detection
   - Performance stability
   - Error rate tracking

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Feature importance visualization
   - Feature quality metrics
   - Feature automation

## Data Flow

The AURA platform follows a clear data flow pattern:

1. **Data Collection**
   - API connections to various data sources
   - Structured and unstructured data handling
   - Real-time and batch processing

2. **Data Processing**
   - Data cleaning and transformation
   - Feature extraction
   - Integration of multiple data types

3. **Analysis & Insight Generation**
   - AI model inference
   - Risk scoring
   - Alert generation

4. **Presentation**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Drill-down capabilities
   - Alert notifications

## Frontend Component Architecture

The frontend is organized into reusable components:

```
App.js
├── Header
├── CompanyInfoSection
├── HistoricalTrendAnalysis
├── DashboardGrid
│   ├── AlertCards
│   ├── OpinionMiniCards
│   └── RadarCard
├── AssetStructurePieChart
└── BusinessRiskHeatmap
```

The application uses custom hooks to manage data fetching and state:

- `useFinanceData`: Manages financial statement data
- `useOpinionData`: Handles sentiment analysis data
- `useCompanyData`: Calculates risk scores and metrics
- `useAlerts`: Manages alert notifications

## Backend API Structure

The backend API is organized into logical modules:

```
backend/app
├── main.py                 # Application entry point
├── api/                    # API endpoints
│   ├── finance.py          # Financial data endpoints
│   ├── fake_data.py        # Mock data generation
│   ├── alerts.py           # Alert notification endpoints
│   ├── fake_opinion.py     # Opinion analysis endpoints
│   └── platform/           # Platform management
│       ├── data_sources.py # Data source management
│       └── models.py       # AI model management
└── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
```

## Security Considerations (Future Implementation)

While the demo focuses on functionality, a production implementation would include:

- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption
- Audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Secure API communications

## Scalability Aspects (Future Implementation)

The architecture is designed to support scaling through:

- Microservices decomposition
- Containerization
- Cloud-native deployment
- Horizontal scaling
- Load balancing

## Conclusion

The AURA platform demonstrates a modern, cloud-native architecture for audit risk monitoring. While the current implementation focuses on demonstrating the product's capabilities through UI and logic simulation, the architecture provides a solid foundation for developing a production-ready system that could transform the audit industry through comprehensive risk analytics.
